# Riddle Me This

I'm a student at Code Institute and I've reached my third milestone project which was to create this webapplication.

## What does it do?

This website shows riddles and waits for answer from the user.
It checks if the answers are right or not, saves the user and his points.
It shows the points of all the users in a leaderboard.

## Features

Automated tests was not written but all of the elements of the page has been tested manually on:
* Mozilla Firefox

Scenerios:
1. Username form:
    1. Try to submit the empty form, an error message about the required field appears
    2. Try to submit an existing username, an error message appears
    3. Try to submit the form with valid input and you will be forwarded to the first riddle
2. Answer form:
    1. Try to submit the empty form, an error message about the required field appears
    2. Try to submit a worng answer, you stay at the same riddle and text with wrong answer appears
    3. Try to submit the form with good answer and you will be forwarded to the next riddle  
    4. If there is no more riddle you will get your score and can go to ,,Leaderboard"
3. Leaderboard:

4. Log Out:
    1. If you want to log out you will be forwarded to the "logout" page
    2. After logout the username will be popped from session so you can start a new game

## Deployment

This project was created on [C9.IO](https://c9.io/) and was deployed to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

### Getting the code up and running

1. Firstly you will need to clone this repository by running the git clone <project's Github URL> command
2. After you've that you'll need to make sure that you have npm installed
3. After those dependencies have been installed you'll need to make sure that you have http-server installed.
4. After that you will need to modify the ,,app.secret_key" to any string
5. Once these are done run the server
6. The project will now run on localhost
